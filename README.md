# iMEP
Dear all, to make work a bit easier, 
I've written a simple Word macro that automatically fills in the party (e.g., EPP) and country abbreviations (e.g., NL) of MEPs.

All you need to do is write the MEP's surname in capital letters, followed by (XX/XX). 
After activating the macro, the rest of the information will be added automatically. 

However, it is important that you write the MEP's surname perfectly; otherwise, the macro won't recognise it.
So, in short: After running the macro, **WEBER (XX/XX) becomes WEBER (EPP/DE)**.

All best,
Chris VAN DE WEIJER
